There are three steps to trian dynamic word embeddings on one language. 

1. `python preprocess.py`
2. `python word2vec.py`
3. `python generate_similarities.py`
4. run the code inside `r_analysis` folder to visualize the results.

## Analysis

The analysis code is in R. Please refer to the R code in the repository.
